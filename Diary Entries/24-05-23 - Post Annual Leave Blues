Took a week off leave which was originally booked back in January/February as a forced requirement due to having too much leave.
No time was taken off from the old retail job.
Got a new desktop computer the week before and had it set up with Windows 10 Pro. Some minor issues with the computer making an odd sound but I'm hoping it'll go away on its own as it doesn't always occur.
While I thought I had something of a plan going I ended up not being productive at all with learning anything or completing any 'Life Admin'.
Going forward I think I'll add a "mood" at the start of each entry. If I were to add one for today's entry it would be "apathetic" after having a third request at a pay rise rejected.
