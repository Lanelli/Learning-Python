Mood: 7AM start at work; still ready to quit.

Managed to snag a free code to the famous 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python' course that Al Sweigart posts monthly to Reddit within the first ~5 hours this time.
Sent the link to Lenny as well.

Wonder how well I'll do given that I barely started the CS50X course before.
