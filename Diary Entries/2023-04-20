The "Pygmalion" Effect
  The Pygmalion effect, or Rosenthal effect, is a psychological phenomenon in which high expectations lead to improved performance in a given area and low expectations lead to worse.

From this we can determine that we need to set higher expectations of ourselves and then also surround ourselves with less negative attitudes and less negative people in order to be actively engaged. Much like the noted memory functions from yesterday (see: Mindfulness) it's important that the brain remain healthy to stimulate a response.
