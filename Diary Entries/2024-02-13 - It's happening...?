Mood: Bleak outlook

I've had to abandon encouraging others to pursue a better life since it was preventing me from moving on mentally as well.

This Data Annotation thing might be a nice little way to bring in a bit more money during what little downtime I have already.

Started dabbling in Python by using W3Schools and testing snippets of code functions like creating and writing to files.
Can only hope that I maintain any of this and develop some kind of interest since it will also help with Data Annotation.
