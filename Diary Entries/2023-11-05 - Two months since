Mood: Anhedonic - the usual unable to enjoy anything after comparing myself to literally anyone else doing well in their life.

Since the last post in September there has been zero progress. No planning, no reviews, no collection of resources.

Work has gotten worse, clearly no value being generated and not even treading water. No increase in pay despite workload arguably increasing. Was again "threatened" with an Operations job and being called useless in Support; didn't the Ops job both pay more and was closed because there's no availability with that team?

In terms of life admin, I had a week off along with the Fridays of September. Some things were done but the major tasks were never completed.
A lot of the early week from the week off in October was spent "winding down" which was really just an excuse to do nothing. Everything that happened was just an excuse. I still have three major tasks to complete with one having a deadline of 31st of October.

The other work is just as bad as always. High expectations of picking up the slack but no acknowledgement; just the expectation.

Every so often I do a review of my position in finances and it never really changes: always treading water because the income streams never change. Doing really badly in this day and age.
