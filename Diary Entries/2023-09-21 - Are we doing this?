Mood: Hopeful even if dead. There's a pilot light still flickering that needs to be ignited.

Had a quick look at one of the old diary entries - how depressing!
I need to get around to starting this since it looks like the tech job is winding down with tasks and responsibilities.
The old line-manager said to keep the old job, but the way he said it was as if he knew something was coming down the pipeline regarding the security of my job.

Taking Friday's off for the month of September to use up some Annual Leave. Just doing life admin on these since there's not much else I can sit down and use the time productively on.
At some point I'll need to use this time to do studying as well.

Lightly grazed W3School's Python training.
Single line comments in code using # and then multi-line/paragraph comments using """ makes no sense. I'm sure there's a reason for this I'll discover in years' time.

What's the goal? It's already late September.
