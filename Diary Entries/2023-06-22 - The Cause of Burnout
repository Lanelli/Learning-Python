Mood: Still ready to quit, but need the cashflow. Taking into consideration on staying regretfully

As the winter solstice has approached and we are nearing the end of the financial year, the deadline quickly approaches on whether or not I should be quitting this low-paying job.
A study of thousands of Wisconsin residents in their 60s from the past seven years of their working life has shown that the high cause of burnout are jobs that have high expectations and low control (or agency) within their roles.
Sounds familiar doesn't it?

Took the day off yesterday (Wednesday 21 June) from the tech job. No urgent calls so there was nothing to worry about.

These are less programming related and now just rambles, aren't they?

No progress on learning Python or anything else.
