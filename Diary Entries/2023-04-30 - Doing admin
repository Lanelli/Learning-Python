Figured out why the order of the files in this Diary Entries folder was incorrect: the first one I created was dated as the 14th month instead of the 4th month.
Truly a great sign that there is going to be a lot of human error being overlooked in the future.

Decided to add titles to the date entries so it's easier to see what I did that day when looking them back up.

Have made no real progress.
