Figured out why the order of the files in this Diary Entries folder was incorrect: the first one I created was dated as the 14th month instead of the 4th month.
Truly a great sign that there is going to be a lot of human error being overlooked in the future.

Decided to add titles to the date entries so it's easier to see what I did that day when looking them back up.

Checked Al Sweigart has made another reddit post with free codes to his 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python' e-learning series only to find he does have a free e-book titled 'The Big Book of Small Python Projects', which can be found here: https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/

Have made no real progress.
